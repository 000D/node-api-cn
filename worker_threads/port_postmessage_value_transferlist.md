* `value` {any}
* `transferList` {Object[]}

Sends a JavaScript value to the receiving side of this channel.
`value` will be transferred in a way which is compatible with
the [HTML structured clone algorithm][]. In particular, it may contain circular
references and objects like typed arrays that the `JSON` API is not able
to stringify.

`transferList` may be a list of `ArrayBuffer` and `MessagePort` objects.
After transferring, they will not be usable on the sending side of the channel
anymore (even if they are not contained in `value`). Unlike with
[child processes][], transferring handles such as network sockets is currently
not supported.

If `value` contains [`SharedArrayBuffer`][] instances, those will be accessible
from either thread. They cannot be listed in `transferList`.

`value` may still contain `ArrayBuffer` instances that are not in
`transferList`; in that case, the underlying memory is copied rather than moved.

Because the object cloning uses the structured clone algorithm,
non-enumerable properties, property accessors, and object prototypes are
not preserved. In particular, [`Buffer`][] objects will be read as
plain [`Uint8Array`][]s on the receiving side.

The message object will be cloned immediately, and can be modified after
posting without having side effects.

For more information on the serialization and deserialization mechanisms
behind this API, see the [serialization API of the `v8` module][v8.serdes].
