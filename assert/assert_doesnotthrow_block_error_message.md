Asserts that the function `block` does not throw an error. See
[`assert.throws()`][] for more details.

When `assert.doesNotThrow()` is called, it will immediately call the `block`
function.

If an error is thrown and it is the same type as that specified by the `error`
parameter, then an `AssertionError` is thrown. If the error is of a different
type, or if the `error` parameter is undefined, the error is propagated back
to the caller.

The following, for instance, will throw the [`TypeError`][] because there is no
matching error type in the assertion:

```js
assert.doesNotThrow(
  () => {
    throw new TypeError('Wrong value');
  },
  SyntaxError
);
```

However, the following will result in an `AssertionError` with the message
'Got unwanted exception (TypeError)..':

```js
assert.doesNotThrow(
  () => {
    throw new TypeError('Wrong value');
  },
  TypeError
);
```

If an `AssertionError` is thrown and a value is provided for the `message`
parameter, the value of `message` will be appended to the `AssertionError`
message:

```js
assert.doesNotThrow(
  () => {
    throw new TypeError('Wrong value');
  },
  TypeError,
  'Whoops'
);
// Throws: AssertionError: Got unwanted exception (TypeError). Whoops
```
