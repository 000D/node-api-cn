The `assert` module provides a simple set of assertion tests that can be used to
test invariants. The module is intended for internal use by Node.js, but can be
used in application code via `require('assert')`. However, `assert` is not a
testing framework, and is not intended to be used as a general purpose assertion
library.

The API for the `assert` module is [Locked][]. This means that there will be no
additions or changes to any of the methods implemented and exposed by
the module.
