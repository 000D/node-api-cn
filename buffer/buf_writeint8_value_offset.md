    description: Removed `noAssert` and no implicit coercion of the offset
                 to `uint32` anymore.
-->

* `value` {integer} Number to be written to `buf`.
* `offset` {integer} Number of bytes to skip before starting to write. Must
  satisfy `0 <= offset <= buf.length - 1`.
* Returns: {integer} `offset` plus the number of bytes written.

Writes `value` to `buf` at the specified `offset`. `value` *should* be a valid
signed 8-bit integer. Behavior is undefined when `value` is anything other than
a signed 8-bit integer.

`value` is interpreted and written as a two's complement signed integer.

```js
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(2);

buf.writeInt8(2, 0);
buf.writeInt8(-2, 1);

console.log(buf);
// Prints: <Buffer 02 fe>
```
