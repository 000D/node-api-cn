    description: Removed `noAssert` and no implicit coercion of the offset
                 to `uint32` anymore.
-->

* `value` {integer} Number to be written to `buf`.
* `offset` {integer} Number of bytes to skip before starting to write. Must
  satisfy `0 <= offset <= buf.length - 4`.
* Returns: {integer} `offset` plus the number of bytes written.

Writes `value` to `buf` at the specified `offset` with specified endian
format (`writeInt32BE()` writes big endian, `writeInt32LE()` writes little
endian). `value` *should* be a valid signed 32-bit integer. Behavior is
undefined when `value` is anything other than a signed 32-bit integer.

`value` is interpreted and written as a two's complement signed integer.

```js
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(8);

buf.writeInt32BE(0x01020304, 0);
buf.writeInt32LE(0x05060708, 4);

console.log(buf);
// Prints: <Buffer 01 02 03 04 08 07 06 05>
```
