Emitted when the other end of the socket sends a FIN packet.

By default (`allowHalfOpen == false`) the socket will destroy its file
descriptor  once it has written out its pending write queue.  However, by
setting `allowHalfOpen == true` the socket will not automatically `end()`
its side allowing the user to write arbitrary amounts of data, with the
caveat that the user is required to `end()` their side now.
