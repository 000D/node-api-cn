Throughout the documentation, you will see indications of a section's
stability.  The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it
matures, certain parts are more reliable than others.  Some are so
proven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at
all.  Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous
and in the process of being redesigned.

The stability indices are as follows:

```txt
Stability: 0 - Deprecated
This feature is known to be problematic, and changes are
planned.  Do not rely on it.  Use of the feature may cause warnings.  Backwards
compatibility should not be expected.
```

```txt
Stability: 1 - Experimental
This feature is subject to change, and is gated by a command line flag.
It may change or be removed in future versions.
```

```txt
Stability: 2 - Stable
The API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem
is a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely necessary.
```

```txt
Stability: 3 - Locked
Only fixes related to security, performance, or bug fixes will be accepted.
Please do not suggest API changes in this area; they will be refused.
```
