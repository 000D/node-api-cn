* `chunk` {String | Buffer}
* `encoding` {String}
* `callback` {Function}

Sends a chunk of the body.  By calling this method
many times, the user can stream a request body to a
server--in that case it is suggested to use the
`['Transfer-Encoding', 'chunked']` header line when
creating the request.

The `encoding` argument is optional and only applies when `chunk` is a string.
Defaults to `'utf8'`.

The `callback` argument is optional and will be called when this chunk of data
is flushed.

Returns `request`.
