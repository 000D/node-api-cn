* `from` {String} The Base URL being resolved against.
* `to` {String} The HREF URL being resolved.

The `url.resolve()` method resolves a target URL relative to a base URL in a
manner similar to that of a Web browser resolving an anchor tag HREF.

For example:

```js
url.resolve('/one/two/three', 'four')         // '/one/two/four'
url.resolve('http://example.com/', '/one')    // 'http://example.com/one'
url.resolve('http://example.com/one', '/two') // 'http://example.com/two'
```
