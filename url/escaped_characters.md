URLs are only permitted to contain a certain range of characters. Spaces (`' '`)
and the following characters will be automatically escaped in the
properties of URL objects:

```txt
< > " ` \r \n \t { } | \ ^ '
```

For example, the ASCII space character (`' '`) is encoded as `%20`. The ASCII
forward slash (`/`) character is encoded as `%3C`.
