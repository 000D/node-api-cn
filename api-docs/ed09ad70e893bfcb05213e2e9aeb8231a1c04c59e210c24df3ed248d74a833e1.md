    description: Underscores instead of dashes are now allowed for
                 Node.js options as well, in addition to V8 options.
-->

All options, including V8 options, allow words to be separated by both
dashes (`-`) or underscores (`_`).

For example, `--pending-deprecation` is equivalent to `--pending_deprecation`.
