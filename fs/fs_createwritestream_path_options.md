* `path` {String | Buffer}
* `options` {String | Object}

Returns a new [`WriteStream`][] object. (See [Writable Stream][]).

`options` is an object or string with the following defaults:

```js
{
  flags: 'w',
  defaultEncoding: 'utf8',
  fd: null,
  mode: 0o666,
  autoClose: true
}
```

`options` may also include a `start` option to allow writing data at
some position past the beginning of the file.  Modifying a file rather
than replacing it may require a `flags` mode of `r+` rather than the
default mode `w`. The `defaultEncoding` can be any one of those accepted by
[`Buffer`][].

If `autoClose` is set to true (default behavior) on `error` or `end`
the file descriptor will be closed automatically. If `autoClose` is false,
then the file descriptor won't be closed, even if there's an error.
It is your responsibility to close it and make sure
there's no file descriptor leak.

Like [`ReadStream`][], if `fd` is specified, `WriteStream` will ignore the
`path` argument and will use the specified file descriptor. This means that no
`'open'` event will be emitted. Note that `fd` should be blocking; non-blocking
`fd`s should be passed to [`net.Socket`][].

If `options` is a string, then it specifies the encoding.
