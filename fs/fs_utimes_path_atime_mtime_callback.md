* `path` {String | Buffer}
* `atime` {Integer}
* `mtime` {Integer}
* `callback` {Function}

Change file timestamps of the file referenced by the supplied path.

Note: the arguments `atime` and `mtime` of the following related functions
follow these rules:

- The value should be a Unix timestamp in seconds. For example, `Date.now()`
  returns milliseconds, so it should be divided by 1000 before passing it in.
- If the value is a numeric string like `'123456789'`, the value will get
  converted to the corresponding number.
- If the value is `NaN` or `Infinity`, the value will get converted to
  `Date.now() / 1000`.
