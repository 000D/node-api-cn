<!-- type=misc -->

These objects are available in all modules. Some of these objects aren't
actually in the global scope but in the module scope - this will be noted.

The objects listed here are specific to Node.js. There are a number of
[built-in objects][] that are part of the JavaScript language itself, which are
also globally accessible.
