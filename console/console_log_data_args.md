Prints to `stdout` with newline. Multiple arguments can be passed, with the
first used as the primary message and all additional used as substitution
values similar to printf(3) (the arguments are all passed to
[`util.format()`][]).

```js
var count = 5;
console.log('count: %d', count);
// Prints: count: 5, to stdout
console.log('count:', count);
// Prints: count: 5, to stdout
```

If formatting elements (e.g. `%d`) are not found in the first string then
[`util.inspect()`][] is called on each argument and the resulting string
values are concatenated. See [`util.format()`][] for more information.
